# Coding Rules

1. **Modularity:**  
   - Break code into small, separate files for each feature (e.g., `scraping.py`, `meme_generation.py`).

2. **Naming:**  
   - Use clear, descriptive names for files, functions, and variables (e.g., `generate_meme_from_text`).

3. **Security:**  
   - Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables, not in the code.

4. **Comments:**  
   - Add comments to explain complex logic or decisions, making the code easier to maintain.

5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**  
   - Use functions or modules to avoid repeating code across the project.

6. **Testing:**  
   - Test each feature or step before moving to the next one to catch issues early.
