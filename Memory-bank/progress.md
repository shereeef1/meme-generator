# Progress Tracker

## Step 1: Set Up Flask Backend with Firebase

- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Notes:** Implemented basic Flask app with Firebase integration. Created modular structure with placeholder modules for all key functionalities: meme generation, brand scraping, news integration, and export. Set up configuration for environment variables and Firebase.
- **Insights:** Using a modular approach with separate Python modules for each feature will make the codebase easier to maintain and expand. Firebase integration provides a quicker path to MVP than a custom PostgreSQL setup.

## Step 2: Integrate Supreme Meme AI API

- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Notes:** Successfully integrated with Supermeme.ai API. Fixed initial URL and API endpoint issues. Implemented proper error handling and response parsing. The API returns multiple meme variations (16 different memes) for each text input.
- **Insights:** API documentation was essential for understanding the correct endpoint and response format. The API provides temporary URLs that expire after 1 hour, which is important to consider for our frontend implementation.

## Step 3: Build Basic React Frontend

- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Notes:** Created a React frontend with a form for text input and a gallery to display and select generated memes. Used Bootstrap for styling. Implemented responsive design with a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **Insights:** The meme gallery allows users to browse and select from all 16 variations returned by the API. Added download and preview functionality for the selected meme. Temporary URLs from the API (valid for 1 hour) impact user experience - users should be informed of this limitation.
