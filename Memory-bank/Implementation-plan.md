# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Set Up Flask Backend with Firebase

- **Task:** Create a basic Flask app with Firebase integration and a health check route.
- **Test:** Run the app locally and verify Firebase connection and health check endpoint.

## Step 2: Integrate Supreme Meme AI API

- **Task:** Write a function to send text to the Supreme Meme AI API and retrieve a meme image.
- **Test:** Send a sample text (e.g., "Test meme") and verify that an image is returned.

## Step 3: Build Basic React Frontend

- **Task:** Create a simple React app with a text input and button to trigger meme generation.
- **Test:** Click the button and check if it calls the backend endpoint.

## Step 4: Implement Brand Data Scraping

- **Task:** Write a Python module to scrape brand data (e.g., product names, descriptions) from a given URL.
- **Test:** Provide a sample URL and verify that the correct data is scraped and stored in Firebase.

## Step 5: Add News Integration

- **Task:** Integrate NewsAPI to fetch trending news and filter it for relevance to the brand.
- **Test:** Fetch news and check if the filtering works for a sample brand's industry or keywords.

## Step 6: Develop Customization Tools

- **Task:** Add basic editing features (e.g., text overlay, font changes) to the React frontend.
- **Test:** Generate a meme, apply a customization (e.g., change text), and check if it updates correctly.

## Step 7: Enable Export Options

- **Task:** Add functionality to export memes as PNG or JPEG files and store in Firebase Storage.
- **Test:** Export a meme and verify that the file is downloadable and displays correctly.

## Step 8: Add User Authentication (Future Enhancement)

- **Task:** Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication after validating core product value.
- **Test:** Register a test user and verify login functionality.
